💕 **--Preview on Vicky's drama opera--**
<br />
🌑Welcome Back,and this chapter is about dark moments
<br />
<br />
1️⃣ Financial college student Vicky woke up,looked back on the past year and found that most of the time it was pain 😭 Memories.
<br />
2️⃣ Youth Lost, Suspension of School, Entrepreneurship  I have struggled with depression and recovered from it 、 The application collapsed and cried loudly 🤢
3️⃣ It seems that in the end, it was jokingly cured by the demon wind in Beijing 🙀
<br />
4️⃣ But who said they would become a better child after their birthday? However, who mentioned life and accidents again? I don't know who came first 🫀
<br />
<br />
Anyway is better or worse, or has she lived past the age of 21? Let's congratulate her together!
